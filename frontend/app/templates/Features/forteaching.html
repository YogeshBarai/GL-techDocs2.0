                <p class="card-text">
                    <li>Using our link sharing function is the simplest method to share an assignment with your
                        students. You may provide your assignment as a read-only project, which they can then duplicate
                        and complete before submitting.</li>
                    <li>You may post your templates and examples in the TechDocs gallery so that your students can
                        utilise them right away. This article will teach you how to publish templates on TechDocs.</li>
                    <li>If you want to host your own LaTeX templates, you may use our API to generate simple links to
                        open them in TechDocs. It's as simple as clicking Open this homework assignment to see for
                        yourself. Every student who clicks the link will generate their own personal copy to fill out
                        and submit.</li>
